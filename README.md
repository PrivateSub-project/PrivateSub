### Background

---

As technology has been developed and modernized, it improves the peoples’ demands to have an efficient living. With the evolution of the Internet, all online transactions and subscriptions to social network media are made by real, physical payment cards. However, setting memberships to different e-commerce web services would lead to many issues for individuals, such as poor memory for remembering all listed subscriptions, money loss from card transactions, and security concerns. The current system of most applications cannot cancel auto-pay subscriptions automatically, which has been processed by real credit cards.

Traditional credit cards mostly rely on banking systems with the current use of physical payments cards. Any mistake of using the cards for purchasing ‘purposes can cause time-consuming to put the client through a representative for any solving problems. Although physical cards can be used for online memberships, more issues have been encountered in this case, like the process of re-issuing and filling in the repetitive forms when expired, lost, or stolen. Consequently, Certain businesses will discover the criteria of having physical cards are a less flexible choice and do not always match the scenarios of customer’s needs. By reducing the substantial number of casualties, our objectives need to be productive and convenient to improve customer requirements.
